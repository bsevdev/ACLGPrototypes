Test Cases: 

Things we need to detect: 

- Detect error

check if the signature is valid. If invalid, throw error.
- Get the signature "-33"
- place in string
- check if it is equal to all index. If ALL fail, throw error





General testing

123 = D0-D6-D3-44

In place: 

- if decrypted data is larger than max, error
- if encrypted data is larger than max, error
- if 1 node is invalid, error
- if signature is invalid, error

- if user enters a "number" to decrypt
